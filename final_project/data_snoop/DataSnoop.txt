In the data snoop step, we made a total of 8 statistical charts, including box plots, frequency histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and heat maps.

1. Box chart
We made a box plot of fixes_percent because we expected to view outliers in this way.
It can be seen from the figure that most of the data is concentrated in 5% to 18%, and a small part of the data exceeds 35%. Later, we will judge this part of the data and analyze the reasons for their generation.

2. Frequency histogram
Regarding lines and total_shas, ​​we made frequency histograms separately, because we expect to know their data scale in this way.
It can be seen from the figure that the number of lines is mostly concentrated in 0~500, the data of 1000~4000 is less, and the data of more than 4000 is the least. The number of total_shas is mostly concentrated in 0~100, less in the range of 100~400, and the least in excess of 400.

3. Pie chart
For authors, we chose a pie chart to understand the proportion of different numbers of people.
It can be seen from the figure that the largest proportion is 10~50 people, about 43.1%; the second is 5~10 people, about 30.2%; the least is 100~200 people, about 0.3%.

4. Scatter chart
We chose three variables to make a scatterplot between fixes_percent, which are lines, authors, and total_shas. The purpose is to check whether there is a correlation between them.
The trend in the graph shows that there may be a negative correlation between these three variables and fixes_percent.

5. Heat map
We choose a heat map to determine the strength of the correlation in this data set.
After observation, it is found that the correlation between each variable and fixes_percent is generally weak, and the absolute values ​​of their correlation coefficients are all between 0.1 and 0.5.
