Hello professor, this txt file is our team work of group05 in Friday class. The results are from different students in our team and includes both git diff result and the reference we used to judge if it is refactory or not from git log -p command line. 
There are four items from 401-500 and two of them are refactory. We have also developed a small program for searching commit that is suitable for the pattern you provided in class. We finally finid 8 items from 1000 that meet the pattern strictly and are similar to the "3 and 5" example you provided in the data1.pdf.
The code for that is in the other file.

$ git log -p HEAD~450..HEAD~449
"Nothing major here, just some small fixes‚Äù
"The driver uses logical only error checking a bool true would flag error"
" It appears that this command has always failed but was ignored by driver until the introduction of error checking."
"The driver standard error returns remove bool false conditions."
"Correct the return function so only return zero when transfer is successful."

Most of opreations are correcting and debug. Generally, refactory!

"riscv: gcov: enable gcov for RISC-V"

Some patch, notrace and 'DT'are added. This is not refactory.

      staging: rtl8188eu: Add device code for TP-Link TL-WN727N v5.21
      staging: comedi: adv_pci1710: fix AI channels 16-31 for PCI-1713
      staging: vt6656: set usb_set_intfdata on driver fail.
      staging: vt6656: remove bool from vnt_radio_power_on ret
      staging: vt6656: limit reg output to block size
      staging: vt6656: correct return of vnt_init_registers.
      staging: vt6656: Fix non zero logical return of, usb_control_msg

Because of add device code this in not refactory!

    Merge tag 'apparmor-pr-2020-01-04' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jj/linux-apparmor

    Pull apparmor fixes from John Johansen:
     - performance regression: only get a label reference if the fast path
       check fails
     - fix aa_xattrs_match() may sleep while holding a RCU lock
     - fix bind mounts aborting with -ENOMEM

Generally refactory
